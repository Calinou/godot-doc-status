## Development

Follow these instructions to set up this site locally for development purposes:

- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your
  operating system.
- Run the `build.sh` script to clone the Godot repository, generate a Markdown
  file and build the website.
  - On Windows 10, you should be able to run this script using the WSL.
- Run `hugo server` while working on the website CSS/JavaScript. The local
  server will reload automatically on file changes.
  - If you need to regenerate `content/_index.md`, run `build.sh` again. You can
    do this while having the development server running.
